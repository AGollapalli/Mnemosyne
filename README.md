# Mnemosyne

## Mnemosyne is a novel.

Mnemosyne is a novel about a bizarre future involving dome-covered cities, buggy mind reading, friendly AI's, nefarious cabals, terrifying church-corporation hybrids, blood gods, transhumanists, a singularity which might or might not have happened, and heroic historians.

I'm putting it up here so that anyone can see the novel as it morphs over time and eventually reaches publishable status.

All the stuff in the directory "Mnemosyne Archive" is stuff I've written over the past 4 years.
Some of it might appear in the final product. Alot of it won't. It was written using Scrivener, 
back before I got a new computer and found my license no longer worked.

All the stuff in "Mnemosyne.org" is what I'm working on atm. 
This is the working file and current state of what would eventually be published.
It's being written in Spacemacs.

You should probably know that my writing philosophy is more like William Gaddis than Steven King. I expect my readers to work, figure things out and fight to understand the work. I don't spoonfeed special snowflakes.
