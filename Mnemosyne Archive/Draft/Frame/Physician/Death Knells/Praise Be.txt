You don’t want to know what lies in the dark. Or around the corner. Especially no the corner where you looked just a second before.
Being jumped by a large black man wielding a sharpened plastic spoon is certainly not one of the more pleasant things which happened.
It was about three weeks after my release solitary confinement. I didn’t know at the time, but hat period of a month would be my safest and sanest period of incarceration.
It was a sunday and it was raining outside. We were escorted past the cells of those souls less pious than I. We tromped discordantly. Some with great lumbering heaves, others with quiet dancers steps, many with limps and creaky knees.
All of us bound for Canterbury.
We walked towards the chapel, slowly spying the wooden pews, scuffed and carved, and the minuscule portcullis containing stained glass. The faint silhouette of bars could be seen in the streams of colored light which trickled their way into the chapel. The chapel did not echo. There was no resonance. The chaplain, spindly young man in his early 40’s began to speak.
“And in God’s love we find ourselves here today…” Severed words were drowned out be the snoring of the grizzled, bowling ball bellied man in front of me.
“Yesterday the president of the great republic was killed. At this time, I would like to pray for this great man’s soul.” As several men’s ears perked up, mine began to droop. My eyes began to turn inward as my mind moved back to my military service.
A weathered young woman looked at me. She did not weep. She did not beg. Her face was lined with the writings of years hunger upon her. Her face was darkened like parchment or burning candle wax. Her frame was spindly. Her breasts sagged. Her belly was bulging just ever so slightly, not unusual in these parts but rather large for tapeworms. Her fingers wound her way around a finger guard, of a gun she had not been taught to hold.
