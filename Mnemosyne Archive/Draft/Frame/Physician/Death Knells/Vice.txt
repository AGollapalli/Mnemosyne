“Vice is the chain that keeps us from standing upright” Simon says to me. I tell him he’s speaking in platitudes and ask him to hand me a cigarette. 

	As his hands caress the filthy white stub, his lilting voice bemoans the hardships involved in acquiring the short lived comforts. I but I don’t understand  as my eyes are drawn to his sun browned skin. Lines radiated from his eyes, wrinkles in time, formed from better days. His gums were rose colored, unstained by the chew which so many prisoners had toaken to abusing. 

	His hunched and stooped posture belay long nights spend reading, though his whitened eyes suggested that he was unable. 
	“Most people would consider that a terrible trade, but these young ones have no concept of foresight. I know what happens when they write their lasses. I know what they’ll want in a couple years time. I saw it all before. It’s the same thing over and over again.”
	
	His oft used fingertips slid over metal dog tags, as though reminding himself of his past self. Over and over the letters stamped into stee, slid into the grooves and caressing the spaces.

	“it’s the same story, over and over. Seen it a thousand times.”
	Simon pat out a wad of clean, white gum as he laboriously rose up from his seat. He walked over, his knees groaning as he set his grin. He handed me the white nubbin and a small steel lighter. He pointed to a gravid looking inmate with a shattered smile and a frosty gaze. Scars rolled across his face emanating from the corners of his mouth down to his jawbone, as though someone had tried to do a Chelsea Grin but cut down instead of up.
	“See that man? He best all of this in here. You have something to trade, he can get you what you need.”
	“I need out”
	“You could sell your soul.”
