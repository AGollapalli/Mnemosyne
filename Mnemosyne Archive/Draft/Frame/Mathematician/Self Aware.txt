%After Consciousness
Clinking like glasses of copper resounded through my sleep-borne head, my sleep-borne head. Blasted clockwork malfunctioning through the room painted red, painted red? The clock struck nine and I wondered why. It’s pitted rusted innards had springs not spry. I wrestled myself through sheets upon which I’d bled, which I’d bled. 
Nose dripping, palms sweating. Eyes cold and white. Damn the time was nine. Poem, cap ___oioe. Grab a cotton rag, and pull yourself out of the shaded bed by which you rested, and into the room in which you inhabited. Can’t say I live here though. Or anywhere else for that matter. 
Matter, mutter, meter, miter, motor. Motor? The motor outside was whirring, spinning the air and the sound waves from its axle to the walls adjoining its base of operations. The days godfingers wended their way beneath the curtains and beckoned me come. So I went, and I saw. The sky was an oily curry of greygold films of clouds bending the light in between the clear-lit blue air. Underneath it was the fence and the hazy energy dome which overlaid the home. My view of the world blotted by a lens flair, a sort of meta-unreality created by the filtration. Underneath it all was the motor, making it all work. Always the machine, making it all work. God is the machine. Made by man’s hands.
