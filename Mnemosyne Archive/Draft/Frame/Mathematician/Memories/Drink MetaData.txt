Synopsis: From *Bolus Insifnificus*: “Once I snuck a sip. It burned my tongue and left me unable to taste for days and I was hyper and my teacher sent me home from school that day. Of course, I rose up in the world and drank actual coffee now, not that bastard brew of my father’s house which strung him out and made him stick and bones with sinew and gristle, no fat on the bone no strength in the limbs, only meanness in the mouth.”
