There beneath the sunny starkist sky was the boy, red nosed, with father in hand leading forward like a sleigh dog driven by wild's deep call. Slipping between the budding light boors and the heavy hopped connoiseurs in the stands of the pancratium, billowing winds caused blustering men to spill their drinks on the stands as they sat in the arena. Spill on me, coating my hair in the sticky amber liquid. My father licked my hair, then he wore the same expression I wore. The sun was slowly baking it onto my head leaving me in a beer helmet to match the battle helms of the Romans below. 
Theirs was the white noise. The deep great noise. It rose out of the bowels of the earth. It rumbled. It pitched. It screamed. It towered and glowered and howled like a gin drunk wolverine. It took my ears and held them head under ankles (earlobes?) and shook them down for coin. It shoved an office building full of bees right into them. It punched me in the gut and took the wind out of me and sent it screaming off westward, It left Aeoulus bag unloosed. It was the great west wind. It was Man. 
Man in all his instance. Man in all his glory. 
And Man thundered his cheers, glowered in victory, and drooped in defeat, noble and indignant. The waves in the grandstand crushed all dissent like crabs on the sand, moving thousands upon thousands of men and boys in feverish oscillation. 
It was football. Utter tumult. Dad loved it dear.
