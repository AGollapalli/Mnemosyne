Walk to the sky my eyes and see what there is to believe. Walk fore my feet toward the while anew. Trot forward my heart, if you stop walking so do I. There are trees everywhere by the fair use promenade. So wait the walker there goes our girl yonder. 
So saith the Autotheist, the Autopoet, the Heterogeneous Autocopulator. The Autodidact Self-Immolator clopped over to the opaque fair skinned victim of cathexis and proceeded the embrace of self satisfaction with a smile unconscious of the other.

The Autodidact Self-Immolator began his reflective castigation. Autoflagellation anew. 
The brilliant facilitator of abstract false postulations of romantic entanglements and shilling novelizations worked quietly at his bench in the hall of learning filled with tomes. Tones of strangulation emitted from his vocal fold epithelium as studies of the lyceum prompted knowledge of his aloneness. Physical inability due to excess adipose deposits prompted the castigation of his instructor and the derision of young compatriots. Lariats of lessons had prompted new self-knowledge to the tune of this: I’m not fit. I'm not fit for this shit.
Repeated trial and error and empirical process of inference had convinced him of his statistically unattractive body structure and facial asymmetry. Spinal fluids provide telemetry in geometrically distorted subluxation. Subluxation via kyhosis and hyperlordosis said the lord of this library, the knowledge empiric, to the learner novice in his habit, the whorl of his topskull uncharacteristically unshaven, So the novice once more hunched over his fluorescently illumined scoll and calligraphed more poetic approximations of the object of his disorder.
Wait the walker there goes our girl yonder. In her skull does no one ponder what waits within? What beauty? what worlds? Locked within her whorls? What beauty, what worlds, that I will never see?
