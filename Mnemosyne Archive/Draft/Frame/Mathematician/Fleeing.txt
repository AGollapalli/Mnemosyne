 Oh God there they are. 

They’re here. They’re there. They’re everywhere. Their gaze sets my hair on fire. I’m a beacon of failure to them. A beacon of all that had potential and bungled. Of all that could have been great and weren’t. Oh, back to filthy breathing air for you. Back to all that you left. You fuckup. You fool.
They walk on by.
