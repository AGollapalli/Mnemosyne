I stepped off the old Honda Nighthawk and slipped my boots through the dewey grass. I watched the sparkling globes slip onto and off of the slick black leather, like worlds in and of themselves, separated by galaxies of black space. Void
Null, and void. Or so it seemed to me as I went through this uncorrupted wild. Now what of the wild was I supposed to see? Was it the dark green forest the night turned blue? Or was it the beautiful black sky brightened by stars afar? Or maybe it was the eyes of night owls staring back at me.
Yes, maybe it was none of those things. Dear, I don’t know.
